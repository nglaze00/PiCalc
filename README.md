# PiCalc
PiCalc is the logic / GUI for a graphing calculator written in Python to be run on a Raspberry Pi Zero. It receives input from the Pi's GPIO pins. In addition to writing the code, I designed a circuit board, got it printed, and soldered buttons to it. The calculator is now fully functional.

Note: This was a project I created to familiarize myself with Python. Since it was one of my earlier projects, the code definitely isn't my best work. I plan to rewrite it eventually.
